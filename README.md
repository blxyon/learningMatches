**Version 1.2.0**

A Python 3.8 program which will be tracking the number of unproductive and productive actions which 
you are doing based on a score. The more productive you are the more positive the app message will be.
The aim is to have 0 or more productive points. You can add productive or unproductive points by the use of the
GUI buttons. All the history will be tracked inside a log file called "logGames.txt", this will include the
time you added each entry of points.

Case scenario example:
1. You play a quick match in your game.
1. You click add a quick game match related button.
1. You do a long subject read.
1. You click the relevant button.
1. You check your score.


(Windows users)Make sure you have Python 3.8 in your PATH var as "python", otherwise change the bat file accordingy.


Another thing to mention is that the txt file will only be updated after you closed the application. In
order to check the current state of "logGames.txt" check your console.
